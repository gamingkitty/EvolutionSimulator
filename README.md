Hello! Welcome to my evolution simulator project.
This github contains the code to an evolution simulator project with creatures that have simple neural networks.
These creatures interact with a grid world, and those that survive reproduce. Over thousands of generations,
their neural networks change and affect their behavior, with only the surviving ones passing their behavior to
their offspring.
